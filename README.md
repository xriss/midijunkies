I have a draw full of old Raspberry PI 1s and 2s. This is their story.

This is an old raspbian build of gamecake with only the alsa midi enabled, so no SDL etc etc.

The fullfat gamecake is rather big and I no longer bother building raspbian, but this lets you do the following with the standard gamecake.midi tool. 

1. Plug a good power supply into the PI
2. Power upto 4 usb-midi keyboards and synths from its USB ports.
3. Redirect midi singnals between them so the keybaord connects direcly to the synth.
